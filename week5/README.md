Style Transfer example with [ml5.js](http://ml5js.org/), training the model with [Spell.run](https://learn.spell.run/)

Here are some [slides](https://bit.ly/2xB9t8K) that introduce what is style transfer and how does it work.

## Training a style transfer model with Spell!

Check out [Transferring Style Tutorial from Spell](https://learn.spell.run/transferring_style) for more info about steps 1 - 3.
1. Preparing your environment
2. Downloading Datasets
3. Training with style.py
4. Converting model to ml5js (Read more at [reiinakano](https://github.com/reiinakano)'s [fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs](https://github.com/reiinakano/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs#adding-your-own-styles))

## Credits
I used the [TensorFlow implementation of fast style tranfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) developed by [Logan Engstrom](https://github.com/lengstrom). And the [fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs](https://github.com/reiinakano/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs) by [Reiichiro Nakano](https://github.com/reiinakano) to convert the tensforflow model to a tf.js model that can used in ml5.js
